# break-it-check — the mandatory anti-theater gate

**This gate is mandatory. No phase latches without it.** Execute mode's step 4
is `break-it-check`, invoked between "write the tests for this phase" and
"write `Landed:` and commit" — nothing skips it, and nothing writes `Landed:`
without it passing.

It discharges *"the test suite should fail loudly when you fix bugs."* For
each behavior named on the phase's `Catches:` line: inject that bug into a
**disposable copy** of the production code, confirm the new test goes red,
discard the copy.

The mechanism is adapted from `verification-before-completion/SKILL.md:84-88`:

```
Write → Run (pass) → Inject bug → Run (MUST FAIL) → Discard copy → Run (pass)
```

with two inversions from that skill: there is no fix to revert — the bug is
**injected** into working code — and the injection happens in a throwaway
`git worktree`, so nothing in the developer's tree is ever at risk (Inviolate
#2: production code is never permanently modified).

**When you tell the developer what you're doing, use plain words — never
"break-it-check," "the gate," "mutation," or "latch"** (see
`references/test-pushback.md § Talking to the developer`). For example: *"Before
I call these tests done, I'll make sure they actually work — I'll slip one
realistic bug into a throwaway copy of the code and confirm the tests catch it,
then throw the copy away. Your real code is never touched."* What each possible
result means for the developer is spelled out in *Explaining results*, below.

## Protocol

Six steps, in order. The order is load-bearing — steps 1 and 2 each protect
against a failure mode that only shows up if they run first.

1. **Sweep, then create one worktree for the phase.** First fix this run's
   identity: run `echo "$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-$$"` **once**, at the first
   `break-it-check` of the session, and reuse the exact string it prints —
   shape `<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<pid>` — as `<run-id>` for every phase after it.
   **Run the command; never invent an id, and never copy one out of any
   example.** Two runs holding the same id sweep each other's live worktrees,
   which is the failure the id exists to prevent. Never regenerate it per
   phase either: a run that changes its own id stops recognizing its own
   strands.

   Then reclaim strands left by a crashed or aborted prior run:

   - `git worktree prune` — reclaims records whose directory is gone or
     unreachable; it never deletes checked-out files.
   - Enumerate `git worktree list --porcelain` and force-remove a worktree
     **iff one of its path components is exactly `paad-test-roadmap-<run-id>`**
     — split the path on `/` and compare components for **equality**. Never a
     substring or "contains" test: run-ids differ only by PID, so a sibling's
     `paad-test-roadmap-20260726-141133-481712` *contains* your
     `paad-test-roadmap-20260726-141133-4817`, and a contains-test
     force-removes that sibling's live worktree mid-mutation. Never match on a
     `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/…` prefix you construct either: git records the
     symlink-resolved path (`/var/…` prints as `/private/var/…`) and `$TMPDIR`
     already ends in `/`, so a constructed prefix matches nothing and the sweep
     silently becomes a no-op.
   - **Do not add an age or mtime arm to catch what run-id scoping leaves
     behind.** The worktree is created once and reused for the whole phase, so
     its mtime does not move while a slow suite runs — any threshold you pick
     force-removes a live phase mid-mutation, which is that same failure
     rescheduled onto a timer. *Why a disposable worktree* covers what happens
     to those strands instead.

   Then create the phase's worktree. Name the directory `phase-<N>` — never the
   roadmap's phase title, which is prose (`Phase X of Y`) and would silently
   nest if it ever contained a `/`:

   ```
   git worktree add "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/paad-test-roadmap-<run-id>/phase-<N>" HEAD
   ```

   That worktree is **reused across the baseline run and every mutation in the
   phase** — one per phase, not one per mutation. This is structural, not an
   optimization to drop under time pressure: a fresh checkout has none of the
   gitignored build artifacts (`node_modules/`, `target/`, venv) that the skill
   cannot language-agnostically reinstall, so the cost is paid once per phase
   rather than once per mutation. See *Why a disposable worktree* for the full cost.

2. **Copy the phase's new test files into the worktree, *then* mutate.**
   Never the other way around. In colocated-test ecosystems — Rust's
   `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` is the reproduced case — the test file *is* the
   production file. If the mutation were applied first and the test copied
   in second, the copy would silently overwrite the mutation: the test would
   stay green, and the gate would misread a mutation that was never actually
   applied as a theater test. Copy-then-mutate is the only order that can't
   erase its own injected bug.

3. **Baseline run.** Run the phase's own tests, unmutated, in the worktree.
   They **must pass**, and the result must be **stable across two runs**. See
   the *Failure table* below for what each way of failing this step means —
   do not proceed past a baseline that isn't clean green and stable.

4. **Per behavior on `Catches:`, inject one mutation via a blind mutator
   subagent.** The subagent receives:

   - the `Catches:` behavior text,
   - the production file,
   - the worktree path,
   - the operator list (below),

   and explicitly **not the test**. It returns one hunk. The main agent
   applies the **first** hunk returned, runs the phase's own tests, and
   checks for red. There is no re-rolling for a more convenient hunk — see
   *Constrained mutation* for why.

   Blinding the subagent to the test is the point: a subagent that can see
   the test could tune the mutation to whatever the test happens to check,
   which reintroduces the exact failure mode this gate exists to catch — the
   same author writing both the test and the thing meant to indict it.

5. **`git worktree remove --force`.** `--force` is required, not optional —
   the worktree is unclean by construction (the copied-in test is untracked,
   the injected mutation is a tracked-file modification), and a bare
   `git worktree remove` refuses an unclean worktree, telling you to pass
   `--force`. There is nothing to restore, nothing to stage, no fence to
   satisfy first: this is only the fast path. Step 1's sweep is the
   guarantee — see *Why a disposable worktree* below.

6. **Commit only after the check passes** — and after execute mode's step 5
   clean-run gate also passes — on the developer's real tree. This gate proves
   the phase's tests catch a bug; that one proves they run clean in the full
   suite on the branch. Both precede the commit. The operator name(s) used here
   are echoed to the transcript and recorded on the phase's `Landed:` line as
   provenance.

**"Run the test" means the phase's own tests, not the whole suite**, at every
step above. Mutating production code *should* break unrelated tests — that's
expected, not signal — so there's no reason to run the full suite here, and a
legacy suite's pre-existing failures stay out of frame.

## Constrained mutation

The injected mutation is not free-form. It is a single change drawn from a
named operator set, and the subagent must **declare which operator by
name** when it returns its hunk:

- flip a comparison (`<` ↔ `<=`, `==` ↔ `!=`)
- off-by-one a boundary
- negate a condition
- alter a constant
- drop a state transition

**Explicitly banned, regardless of operator name:**

- an early `return` / `raise` / `throw` at function entry
- removing a whole function body

These two are banned by shape, not by judgment call, because they are
sledgehammers: either one makes *any* test go red — including a theater test
like `assert result is not None` — which would let a genuinely worthless test
pass the gate for the wrong reason. "Keep the mutation small" is a
rationalizable instruction; "no early return at function entry" is a concrete
line an agent cannot talk itself around. Requiring the operator to be named
turns a dishonest mutation into an affirmative written claim instead of a
silent choice.

**If the first hunk leaves the test green, that is the theater row in the
table below — rewrite the test. Do not re-roll the mutation.** Re-rolling
would let the main agent shop for a hunk that happens to turn the test red,
which quietly restores the identity the blind-mutator subagent exists to
break: one author controlling both the test and the thing meant to indict
it. A test that survives one honest, named mutation attempt on the behavior
it claims to cover has already told you what it needs to tell you.

## Failure table

Five outcomes. Each is a different failure of a different precondition the
gate depends on, and each has one correct action — never "fix the code" and
never "latch anyway."

| Outcome | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline red (fails unmutated, run alone) — but green in a full-suite run | **Order dependence**, not a mischaracterization: the test relies on state another test sets up. The isolated gate cannot judge it. | **Surface it. The phase cannot use the isolated gate as-is.** Do not latch, do not "fix" the code. |
| Baseline red (fails unmutated) — and also red in a full-suite run | The test does not describe current behavior — **mischaracterization**. | **Rewrite the test.** Do not fix the code, do not latch. |
| Baseline result unstable across two runs | The test is **flaky** — its verdict is noise, so the gate cannot judge it. | **Surface it.** Do not latch. |
| No code path implements this `Catches:` behavior (no valid site to inject) | The phase was planned against code that has since moved or vanished. | **Phase invalidated — re-plan it.** Do not latch. |
| Mutation applied, test stayed green | **Theater** — the test does not catch what the phase claims. | **Rewrite the test.** Do not latch. Do not re-roll the mutation. |

**"Run the test" in every row above means the phase's own tests, not the
whole suite.** The order-dependence and flaky rows exist because the
isolated gate silently *depends on* the phase's tests being isolable and
deterministic — this table is where those two preconditions get checked,
and where a violation of either gets named and surfaced rather than papered
over. Naming the violation is the whole of this gate's engagement with
suite health; it detects the two failure modes, it does not repair them.

The "no code path" row is the design's staleness detector: a bug cannot be
injected into a code path that has moved or vanished, and no phase latches
without passing this gate — so a stale plan gets caught here, not silently
latched against a `Produces:` path that no longer means what it once did.

## Explaining results to the developer

The table's labels — "theater," "mischaracterization," "order dependence,"
"flaky," "invalidated" — are for the agent. Tell the developer what the result
means for their tests, in plain words (§ Talking to the developer):

| Outcome | What to say to the developer |
|---|---|
| Mutation applied, test stayed green (*theater*) | *"These tests still passed after I deliberately broke the code they're supposed to check, so they aren't actually testing that behavior. I'll rewrite them so they catch it."* |
| Baseline red, also red in full suite (*mischaracterization*) | *"These tests disagree with how the code behaves right now. Since the job here is to pin down current behavior, I'll fix the tests to match what the code actually does."* |
| Baseline red alone, green in full suite (*order dependence*) | *"These tests only pass when run together with others — run on their own they fail — so I can't confirm them in isolation. That's worth cleaning up before relying on them."* |
| Baseline unstable across two runs (*flaky*) | *"These tests give different results on repeat runs, so I can't trust the outcome yet. They need to be made reliable first."* |
| No code path implements `Catches:` (*invalidated*) | *"The code this set of tests was planned around has moved or been removed, so the plan for it is out of date and I'll redo it."* |

## Why a disposable worktree, not an in-tree mutation

An earlier draft mutated the developer's working tree directly and protected
it with an elaborate write-fence: a whole-tree `git status --porcelain`
snapshot compared before and after each mutation, plus a
`git add`-before-`git checkout` staging dance to survive `git checkout`'s
restore-from-index behavior. Roughly forty lines of protocol existed solely
to make an in-tree mutation survivable — and it still had a window: a crash,
context exhaustion, or a `--watch` runner mid-mutation could leave altered
production code on disk, caught only on the *next* run, after the developer
already had it in front of them.

The worktree deletes the problem instead of fencing it. The mutated copy is
disposable, so there is no invariant left to protect: no snapshot
comparison, no staging, no path-based fence — and the colocated-test hazard
that broke every such fence (in Rust/Zig/D the test file *is* under `src/`)
becomes irrelevant, because you're mutating a copy you're about to throw
away regardless.

**Why `$TMPDIR` and not somewhere under the repo.** Nothing this gate creates
may land in the working tree: a second full checkout under the repo root is
visible to test discovery, linters, the `find`/`grep` recon in this plugin's
own skills, and `git status` — and the skill cannot exempt it, because it does
not edit the developer's `.gitignore`. An earlier draft used
`.git/test-roadmap-worktrees/`, which satisfied that property but hard-fails
wherever `.git` is a *file* rather than a directory: a `git worktree` checkout,
a submodule, a `--separate-git-dir` repo. `$TMPDIR` keeps the
nothing-in-the-working-tree property, behaves identically in all three of those
repo shapes, and gives the sweep a fixed path component to match on.

The **run-id** in that path is what keeps one run's sweep off another's live
worktree. This is not hypothetical caution about a rare double-booking: a
sibling's sweep force-removing a live worktree out from under a running
mutation **has been reproduced**. Two agents on one repo is not exotic — a
developer can open a second session while one sits mid-phase, and both modes
of this skill are built to resume across sittings. Path prefix alone
identifies "worktrees this skill made," not "worktrees belonging to *my*
run." The `paad-test-roadmap-` half of the component is what keeps the
sweep off the developer's *own* hand-made worktrees; the run-id half is what
keeps it off a concurrent session. Both live in the path, so both are
answerable from `git worktree list` output alone.

The same kind of crash the write-fence could not survive can still strand
the **worktree itself** — the disposable checkout, plus its
`.git/worktrees/` record — on any exit that skips step 5: a failure-table
short-circuit, context exhaustion, a `--watch` runner, a hard kill. That is
hygiene, not a safety gap — the developer's tree is never touched either
way, so Inviolate #2 holds regardless of whether step 5 ever runs — but the
leak this time is closed the way the write-fence's window was **not**: on
the next entry, never on the current exit. Step 1's sweep (`git worktree
prune`, plus a force-remove filtered to test-roadmap's own path component
**and** this run's id) runs on the one path a crash cannot skip — the start
of the next phase — so a strand left by a short-circuited phase dies when
the session next enters the gate, instead of persisting for the rest of the
run.

A strand left by a session that died *outright* is out of the run-id sweep's
reach by design, and what reclaims it is `$TMPDIR` — eventually, with an
honest ceiling: `systemd-tmpfiles` defaults to ten days on Linux, many
container and CI images run no cleaner at all, and a project-local `$TMPDIR`
may never be swept. So "the OS reclaims it" can mean "not for ten days" or
"never." That is accepted rather than fixed because the residue is bounded and
non-destructive: disk held by a checkout, plus a phantom row in `git worktree
list` until the directory does go away and `git worktree prune` clears the
record. The developer's tree is untouched either way, which is the property
this design actually protects — and every mechanism that would reclaim it
sooner (an age arm, an unscoped prefix sweep) buys that back by risking a live
sibling's worktree. On-exit removal (step 5) is only the fast path;
the sweep is the guarantee, because no on-exit cleanup survives a crash this
design already declined to trust once.

The cost, stated honestly: a fresh worktree starts with no `node_modules/`,
no `target/`, no venv, no `_build/`. Some ecosystems need a full dependency
install before their tests can even run, and that can cost minutes. This
skill cannot know the install command stack-agnostically, so the mitigation
here is structural, not a lookup table — one worktree per phase, reused
across every mutation in that phase (protocol step 1) — never a built-in
per-language command table.
